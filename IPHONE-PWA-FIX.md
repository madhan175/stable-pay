## 📱 How to Install on iPhone (Step-by-Step)

### Method 1: Standard Installation (Recommended)

1. **Open Safari** on your iPhone (not Chrome - Safari is required for iOS PWAs)

2. **Navigate to your app URL:**
   ```
   https://stable-pay-21.vercel.app
   ```

3. **Tap the Share button** (square with arrow pointing up) at the bottom of Safari

4. **Scroll down** and tap **"Add to Home Screen"**

5. **Customize the name** (optional - default is "StablePay")

6. **Tap "Add"** in the top right corner

7. **Done!** The app icon will appear on your home screen

### Method 2: Using MetaMask In-App Browser

1. **Open MetaMask app** on iPhone
2. **Tap the Browser tab** (bottom navigation)
3. **Enter your app URL:** `https://stable-pay-21.vercel.app`
4. **Use the app normally** - MetaMask will be automatically connected

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After deploying, verify these on your iPhone:

- [ ] Open the app in Safari (not Chrome)
- [ ] Tap Share button → See "Add to Home Screen" option
- [ ] App icon appears correctly when added
- [ ] App opens in standalone mode (no Safari UI)
- [ ] Service worker is registered (check in Safari DevTools)
- [ ] Manifest file is accessible (`/manifest.webmanifest`)
- [ ] All icons load correctly

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### "Add to Home Screen" Not Appearing

**Possible causes:**
1. Not using Safari - Chrome/Firefox on iOS don't support PWAs
2. Site not served over HTTPS - Vercel provides HTTPS automatically
3. Already installed - Check home screen, you may have already added it

**Solution:**
- Use Safari browser only
- Make sure you're on the production URL (HTTPS)
- Clear Safari cache: Settings → Safari → Clear History and Website Data

### App Icon Not Showing

**Possible causes:**
1. Icon files not loading
2. Cache issues
3. Invalid icon format

**Solution:**
- Check browser console for 404 errors on icon files
- Hard refresh: Tap and hold refresh button → "Reload Without Content Blockers"
- Verify icons exist: `/apple-touch-icon.png`, `/pwa-192x192.png`, `/pwa-512x512.png`

### Service Worker Not Registering

**Check in Safari DevTools (on Mac):**
1. Connect iPhone to Mac
2. Open Safari → Develop → [Your iPhone] → [Your Site]
3. Go to Console tab
4. Look for: "✅ PWA: Service Worker registered"

**If not registering:**
- Make sure you're on HTTPS
- Check for errors in console
- Verify `sw.js` file exists at root
