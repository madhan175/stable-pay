# Transaction History & Receipt Download Implementation

## Summary
Fixed transaction history saving for both sender and receiver, and added PDF receipt download functionality for completed transactions.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Update
**File:** `backend/database/update-transactions-schema.sql`
- Added `sender_wallet` field to transactions table
- Created indexes for faster queries on both sender and recipient wallets
- Added proper documentation comments

**To Apply:**
Run the SQL migration on your Supabase database:
```bash
# Execute this in your Supabase SQL Editor:
psql -h <your-supabase-host> -U postgres -d postgres -f backend/database/update-transactions-schema.sql
```

### 2. Backend Updates
**File:** `backend/server.js`
- Added PDFKit library for PDF generation
- Updated transaction saving to include `sender_wallet` field
- Created new endpoint: `GET /tx/receipt/:transactionId` to generate PDF receipts

**Key Features:**
- Both sender and receiver transaction history now properly saved
- Receipts include:
  - Transaction ID and status
  - Amount in INR, USD, and USDT
  - Sender and recipient wallet addresses
  - Transaction hash and block number
  - Gas information
  - Timestamp

### 3. Frontend Updates
**Files:**
- `frontend/src/services/api.ts`: Added `downloadReceipt` function
- `frontend/src/pages/History.tsx`: Added receipt download button

**Key Features:**
- Download button appears on completed transactions from Supabase
- Receipt downloads as PDF file
- Proper error handling

## How It Works

### Transaction Flow
1. **Sender initiates payment** → Transaction created with sender_wallet
2. **Backend processes** → Saves transaction for both sender and receiver
3. **Receiver notified** → Can see incoming payment in history
4. **Both users can download** → PDF receipt for completed transactions

### Receipt Generation
- Click "Receipt" button on any completed transaction in History page
- Backend generates PDF with all transaction details
- PDF automatically downloads to user's device

## Testing

### Test Transaction History
1. Send a payment from one wallet to another
2. Check History page for both sender and receiver
3. Verify both see the transaction

### Test Receipt Download
1. Complete a transaction
2. Go to History page
3. Click "Receipt" button on the transaction
4. Verify PDF downloads with correct details

## Dependencies Added
- `pdfkit` - PDF generation library

## Notes
- Receipt download only works for transactions stored in Supabase
- Make sure to run the database migration before deploying
- PDF includes all relevant transaction metadata
